            Cookie Statement
        </h1>
        <br>
        <p>When we say “we,” “us”, “our,” and “13chats,” we are referring to 13chats as a product of SendPulse Inc., 19 Hill St Bernardsville NJ 07924 USA.</p>
        <p>This Cookie Statement explains how we use cookies and similar technologies in the course of our business, including through our websites that link to this Cookie Statement, such as <a href="https://13chats.com/">https://13chats.com</a>, its subdomains, or any website or application owned, operated or controlled by us (collectively, “Websites” or “websites”), and when our users’ subscribers visit websites or e-commerce stores operated by our users or open or interact with emails delivered through our Services. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them. This Cookie Statement is and will be treated as part of our Privacy Policy, and is automatically incorporated therein. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this Cookie Statement have the meanings given to those terms in our Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>In some cases we may use cookies and other tracking technologies described in this Cookie Statement to collect Personal Data, or to collect information that becomes Personal Data if we combine it with other information. For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please read our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
        <p>Cookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, 13chats) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?</h2>
        <p>We use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. We also enable our users to employ cookies and similar tracking technologies in connection with their use of our Services in order to allow us and our users to track their subscribers. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Cookies served through our Websites</h2>
        <p>The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Essential Website Cookies</h3>
        <p>These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under in the Cookie Statement.</p>
        <h3>Performance and Functionality Cookies</h3>
        <p>These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our websites but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.</p>
        <h3>Analytics and Customization Cookies</h3>
        <p>These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.</p>
        <h3>Advertising (Targeting) Cookies</h3>
        <p>These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled "Targeted online advertising."</p>
        <h2>Other tracking technologies</h2>
        <p>We and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an email that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Targeted online advertising</h2>
        <p>We have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites.</p>
        <p>These third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests.</p>
        <p>Our third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities. The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Cookies served through the Services</h2>
        <h3>User email campaigns</h3>
        <p>We automatically place single pixel gifs, also known as web beacons, in every email sent by our users. These are tiny graphic files that contain unique identifiers that enable us and our users to recognize when their subscribers have opened an email or clicked certain links. These technologies record each subscribers email address, IP address, date, and time associated with each open and click for a campaign. We use this data to create reports for our users about how an email campaign performed and what actions subscribers took.&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>User sites</h3>
        <p>If a user elects to use certain 13chats add-ons or features, the use of those may permit or require additional cookies or tracking technologies to be employed. If a user connects his or her website or e-commerce store (in each case, a “Site”) to a 13chats account, 13chats installs a JavaScript tracking snippet (“Snippet”) on that user’s Site. This Snippet will allow cookies, pixels, and other technologies to be set on that user’s Site to facilitate the use of certain automations, features and functionality offered by 13chats through the Services. The specific cookies, pixels, or other technologies that will be set on a user’s Site depend on the particular add-ons or features that the user chooses to use as part of the Services. Subscribers should therefore review the relevant user’s privacy notice and cookie disclosures for further information about the specific types of cookies and other tracking technologies used on the Site.</p>
        <h2>How can you control cookies</h2>
        <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.</p>
        <p>You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.</p>
        <h2>How often will this Cookie Statement be updated?</h2>
        <p>We may update this Cookie Statement from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Statement regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.</p>
        <p>The date at the bottom of this Cookie Statement indicates when it was last updated.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at <a href="mailto:contact@13chats.com">contact@13chats.com</a> .</p>
