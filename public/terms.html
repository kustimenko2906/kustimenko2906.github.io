        <h3>2.3. Account management</h3>

        <h2>3. Marketing campaigns</h2>
        <p>13chats is a service for Facebook Messenger campaigns. The user has access to the service through his/her customer account (Dashboard).</p>
        <h3>3.1. Creating marketing campaigns</h3>
        <p>Campaigns include communications that have been drawn up, lists of subscribers, and the process of sending campaigns to subscribers. The user creates himself/herself the template for these communications by choosing options provided by the Service, uploading images, and writing texts.</p>
        <p>The user bears full responsibility for the context of mailings, which in turn must correspond to the rules set by the Service’s Anti-Spam Policy. Otherwise, the Service has the right to suspend the user’s account until it has ascertained the circumstances.</p>
        <h3>3.2. Subscribers lists</h3>
        <p>A user of the 13chats service has the right to send communications only to such people who have expressed their consent to receiving communications from him/her. The recipients’ consent must be received by the user personally. Upon the request of the Service administration, the user must provide corresponding proof of recipients’ consent.</p>
        <p>The user shall guarantee subscribers the ability to opt out of any further communications (through the presence of an unsubscribe command in the chat) and shall also be obliged to enter into the unsubscribers list or remove from the list contact details, the owners of which have expressed their desire to opt out of chat messages.</p>
        <p>Use of illegally obtained subscriber bases and distributing spam through the 13chats service is strictly prohibited.</p>
        <h3>3.3.&nbsp; Sending marketing campaigns</h3>
        <p>Facebook campaign created by the user is scheduled for sending through the Service. Each campaign is queued for sending and passes through a moderation process.</p>
        <p>Moderation consists of a check of contacts carried out by Service employees to ensure that the subscriber base is real (should it be suspected that the recipients did not agree to receive mailings) and that the content of the messages corresponds to all rules and regulations of the Anti-Spam Policy.</p>
        <p>The time for moderation and sending of campaigns shall take a maximum of 24 hours.</p>
        <p>In the case that an message did not pass the Service’s moderation, this will be communicated to the user and measures will be taken to remove the grounds for refusing sending, or the user’s account will be blocked until the circumstances are ascertained.</p>
        <h3>3.4. Delivery of marketing campaigns</h3>
        <p>The time when campaigns are delivered to their recipients varies depending on a number of factors and circumstances. 13chats shall not be liable for campaigns being undelivered to recipients, in equal measure, as well as any delays in delivery.</p>

        <p>Any evidence of users not adhering to this Anti-Spam Policy will cause immediate disconnection of his/her spam messages sending, suspension of the Service and might also result in freezing of all money to ensure an immediate end to the violation until the details are cleared up.</p>
        <h3>10.7. Your Right to Cancel / Money Back Guarantee</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You can cancel account subscription in the 13chats Service only until you have sent 200 messages. If exceeded, the user account is considered to be fully working, and no refund will be allowable.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>If your account is cancelled or suspended due to SPAM complaints, no refund will be allowable. See details in our Refund Policy.</li>
            <li>Make sure all recipients agreed to receive messages from you.</li>
            <li>You must ensure that your messages meets the requirements of the CAN-SPAM Act — pay attention to the statement that each message you send with the advertising, commercial, and informative purpose must contain your valid physical address.</li>
            <li>We reserve the right to stop providing service and block user account if even one of your campaign gets over-the-top complaints.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Accounts blocked due to exceeding complaints are denied in getting a refund.</p>
        <p>The limit of non-existing addresses is 7%. If the number of non-valid addresses (non-existent, not active addresses) exceeds, campaign can be blocked by Service moderators. If you want to avoid blocking — check the addresses for validity by any service/software before loading the address into 13chats. 13chats does not provide any validation services.</p>
        <p>We understand that there can be a certain number of complaints if you send bulk messages. According to our Service terms and conditions, we specified a permitted complaints level as around 0.5%-0.7% per single campaign. In addition, we take into consideration different factors like the amount of sent messages well as complaints ratio and types of complaints. However, if your campaign gets a ratio that exceeds the permitted level, we reserve the right to block or terminate your account without a refund.</p>
